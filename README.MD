# What is this

This is a folder containing a collection of some of the simpler ML Scripts/ Projects which I have completed. Each project has its own documentation and code, with datasets provided as necessary. 

It also will contain some folders for learning different modules - for example, the learning CV2 folder. These are not projects, but simply directories containing some learning files and imgs.

# Projects

[Predicting Blood Donations project](https://github.com/PranavEranki/ML-Scripts/tree/master/PredictingBloodDonations) - classification problem from Driven Data.

[Twitter Hate Speech Analysis](https://github.com/PranavEranki/ML-Scripts/tree/master/TwitterHateSpeechAnalysis) - NLP sentiment analysis problem from Analytics Vidhya.
