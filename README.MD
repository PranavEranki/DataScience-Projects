# What is this

This is a folder containing a collection of ML Scripts/ Projects which I have completed. Each project has its own documentation and code, with datasets provided as necessary.

It also contains the learning CV2 folder. These are not projects, but a collection of scripts I used for learning the module. Still, almost all of the scripts are project themed and can be downloaded and used.


## Current highlight

I like to highlight my top few projects here:
* [SMS Spam Detection](https://github.com/PranavEranki/ML-Projects/tree/master/SimpleSpamCollectionSMS) for the documentation, logging, and overall easy interpretability of the code.
* [Stock Market Data Analysis](https://github.com/PranavEranki/ML-Projects/tree/master/StockMarketDataAnalysisSimple) for the high end EDA and analysis of the Quandl data, using matplotlib and seaborn.


# Projects

[Predicting Blood Donations project](https://github.com/PranavEranki/ML-Scripts/tree/master/PredictingBloodDonations) - classification problem from Driven Data.

[Twitter Hate Speech Analysis](https://github.com/PranavEranki/ML-Scripts/tree/master/TwitterHateSpeechAnalysis) - NLP sentiment analysis problem from Analytics Vidhya.

[Stock Market Data Analysis](https://github.com/PranavEranki/ML-Projects/tree/master/StockMarketDataAnalysisSimple) - self practice problem for using some EDA skills I learned.

[Titanic Mini Project](https://github.com/PranavEranki/ML-Projects/tree/master/TitanicMiniProject) which I attempted using a subset of the titanic dataset and some new skills I developed.

[Simple SMS Spam Detection](https://github.com/PranavEranki/ML-Projects/tree/master/SimpleSpamCollectionSMS) is a problem I attempted. One of my best documented and displayed project.

[California House Price Prediction](https://github.com/PranavEranki/ML-Projects/tree/master/California%20Housing%20Price%20Prediction) - this is a simple linear regression problem I attempted to try and learn some new topics.
