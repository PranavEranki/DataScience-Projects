# What is this

This is a folder containing a collection of all ML Scripts and Projects which I have completed. Each project has its own documentation and code, with datasets provided as necessary.

# Projects

[Predicting Blood Donations project](https://github.com/PranavEranki/ML-Scripts/tree/master/PredictingBloodDonations) from Driven Data.

[Twitter Hate Speech Analysis](https://github.com/PranavEranki/ML-Scripts/tree/master/TwitterHateSpeechAnalysis) problem from Analytics Vidhya

[Malicious URL Detector](https://github.com/PranavEranki/ML-Scripts/tree/master/MaliciousUrlDetector) just for fun. Took a while to learn, and was really hard. Took me a long time to implement, and a lot of Stack Overflow was used. One of my best scripts so far.
