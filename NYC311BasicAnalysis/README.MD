# What?

This is a basic data analysis of the NYC 311 dataset, which is not included due to its huge size.

# How?

A lot of the EDA in this project was done using matplotlib, with pandas for separating the data into comparable vectors.

# Learned?

Through this project, I learned how to compare one string feature to a number feature or string feature to determine count per unique string.

Examples:
* Complaints per city
* Max complaint per city

Plotted:
* Bar graph of count vs complaints(top 10 complaints only).
