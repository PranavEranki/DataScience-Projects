# What is this?

This is a simple regression project for predicting house prices based on a variety of features.

I did this project, even though it was quite simple, for a few reasons:
* Handling NaN, which I have not done much of up to this point
* Experimenting with different regressors
* Trying to plot regressor results
* Learning mean squared error

This project was done in the 'Code' jupyter notebook. It contains some simple markdown separating of the code for easier viewing.
