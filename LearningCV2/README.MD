# CV2

This is a computer vision library.

I use it mainly in python.

Here, I have a collection of different scripts, some simple and some complex, for practicing and developing my skills in CV2.

This is just out of fun, and all of these scripts are not very complex and/or awe-inspiring. Simply for learning purposes.
