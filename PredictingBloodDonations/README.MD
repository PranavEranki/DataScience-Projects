My name is Pranav Eranki, and I am a high school student. I do not have much ML experience, as I started in early June 2018. I am somewhat experienced at math, stats, and python as of July 2018, and I am excited to see how this goes.

I am just doing a simple problem from drivendata.org, the 'Predicting Blood Donations'.
