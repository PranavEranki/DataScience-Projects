This is a simple project which I attempted. 

It uses a subset of the titanic dataset from Kaggle.

The intent of the program remains the same, but this program uses a variety of different tactics which I developed between June and August.

Some new things I used:
* Jupyter notebooks - for eaier viewing 
* Better enchancing of data
* EDA with the data
* Kernel SVM classifier
* Model dumping with pickle and joblib from sklearn
